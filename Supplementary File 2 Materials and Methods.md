## *E. coli* sample preparation
*E. coli* MG1655 rpoC:mEos3.2-A69T (CamR) was grown o/n from -70°C glycerol stocks in M9 minimal medium (Merck) at 37°C under constant agitation. This culture was subcultured 1:100 in EZRDM (EZ rich defined medium; Teknova) complemented with 1:100 20% glucose, and grown for 24h, after which it was subcultured the same. This culture was grown for 3 hours, and the cells were directly fixed by adding 150 µL 37% glycerol (pre-warmed to 37°C) to 1350 µL culture and gentle agitation, and this fixation was continued for 20 minutes at 37°C. The cells were washed twice with 500 µL PBS at 37°C by centrifugation at 9000 g, and finally concentrated in 200 µL PBS. This sample was placed on an 8-chamber Ibidi slide, which was beforehand prepared as follows: the slide was cleaned by 15 minutes incubation with 1M KOH, washed twice with distilled water, incubated with poly-L-lysine (PLL) for 20 minutes, washed twice with distilled water. After incubation of the sample on the slide, the sample was washed twice with PBS before imaging.

## Microscopy details – DNA-PAINT origami and E. coli imaging
A custom laser-based fluorescence microscopy setup was used for imaging. 561 nm laser light (gem 561 1000, Laser Quantum) was modulated by an AOTF (G&H; AOMO 3080-125 & AODR 1080AF-AINA-1.0 HCR) and directed via a reflective collimator (RC04FC-P01, Thorlabs) into a custom fibre (70x70 µm multimode square core fibre, NA 0.22, FC/PC connectors, CeramOptec). 405 nm laser light (LBX-405-1200-HPE-PPA, RPMC) was co-aligned and also directed into the same fibre. The fibre output was collimated via a Multimode Collimator (F950FC-A 350-700nm, Thorlabs), and the beam was expanded via a set of lenses (LB1471-A-ML and LA4725-A, Thorlabs), and cleaned up via a ZET405/488/561/640 filter (QuadLineLaserClean-Up, AHF analysentechnik). This beam was then focused via an achromatic lens (AC254-400-A-ML, Thorlabs) and a dichroic mirror (ZT405/488/561rpc, Chroma, Bellows Falls, VT, USA) embedded in a commercial inverted microscope body (Nikon Eclipse Ti-E, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a focus stabilization system (Perfect focus system) on the back-focal plane of a 60x Apochromat TIRF 1.49 NA objective (Nikon). Emission from the sample passed via the objective and dichroic mirror through a filter (ZET405/488/561m-TRF, Chroma) and a 4f system via two convex achromatic lenses (AC508-100-A, Thorlabs), and optionally passed through an emission filter (ET610/75m, Chroma). The light was then directed either towards a Prime BSI sCMOS camera (Teledyne Photometrics, Tucson, AZ, USA; 107 nm pixel size), or towards an event-based sensor (Metavision Gen4.1-HD EVK, Prophesee; 80 nm pixel size). The microscope, camera, and peripherals were controlled via MicroManager 2.0, and laser triggering was controlled via a TriggerScope 4 (Advanced Research Consulting, Newcastle, CA, USA).

For *E. coli* rpoC imaging, the sample was illuminated with ~2 kW/cm<sup>2</sup> 561 nm laser, while the 405nm laser was increased manually from 0 to ~8 W/cm<sup>2</sup> to have a low and steady photoactivation rate, until no new signal appeared. For the Nile Red imaging, the buffer was exchanged for PBS containing 12.5 nM Nile Red, and the sample was illuminated with ~2 kW/cm<sup>2</sup> 561 nm laser and the data was recorded for 3 minutes.

For *E. coli* Nile Red analysis, the frame-based finding method (Detection threshold = 3.0, Exclusion radius = 4.0, Min. Radius = 1.25, Max. Radius = 4.0, Frame time (ms) = 100.0 and Candidate radius = 4.0) was used with the same parameters for positive and negative event polarities separately. For *E. coli* rpoC analysis, the Eigenfeature-based finding method (*Positive polarity:* Linearity cutoff = 0.7, Maximum Eigenvalue cutoff = 45, Number of neighbours = 50, Ratio ms to px = 40, DBSCAN epsilon = 4 and DBSCAN nr. neighbours = 8; *Negative Polarity:* Linearity cutoff = 0.7, Maximum Eigenvalue cutoff = 75, Number of neighbours = 50, Ratio ms to px = 40, DBSCAN epsilon = 4 and DBSCAN nr. neighbours = 5) was used. Logarithmic Gaussian fitting (Time fit routine = Lognormal CDF (first events, weighted), distribution = 2D histogram of x,y positions, expected width = 150.0, fitting tolerance = 4.0) was used for both Nile Red and rpoC.

For DNA-PAINT nanoruler (80RG, Gattaquant) imaging, the sample was illuminated with ~2 kW/cm<sup>2</sup> 561 nm laser in TIRF mode by moving the focused spot to the side of the back-focal plane of the objective, and ~20 minutes of data was recorded.

For DNA-PAINT nanoruler analysis, the Eigenfeature-based finding routine (*Positive polarity:* Linearity cutoff = 0.7, Maximum Eigenvalue cutoff = 18, Number of neighbours = 50, Ratio ms to px = 10, DBSCAN epsilon = 3 and DBSCAN nr. neighbours = 12; *Negative Polarity:* Linearity cutoff = 0.7, Maximum Eigenvalue cutoff = 18, Number of neighbours = 20, Ratio ms to px = 18, DBSCAN epsilon = 3 and DBSCAN nr. neighbours = 8) was combined with logarithmic Gaussian fitting (Time fit routine = Lognormal CDF (first events, weighted), distribution = 2D histogram of x,y positions, expected width = 150.0, fitting tolerance = 1.0; same parameters for both event polarities).

All calibration files (each containing data aquired at different z-positions) were analyzed with EVE, treating all event polarities equally and performing a frame-based finding (Detection threshold = 3.0, Exclusion radius = 4.0, Min. Radius = 1.25, Max. Radius = 4.0, Frame time (ms) = 3200 and Candidate radius = 4.0) and 2D Gaussian fitting (Time fit routine = Average time, distribution = 2D histogram of x,y positions, expected width = 200.0, fitting tolerance = 10.0). The maximum size of a bounding box was adjusted to the frame time of 3200 ms in the advanced settings. For each calibration file analyzed, the x,y-widths of all localizations were then averaged and finally all average localizations were fitted with a fourth degree polynomial depending on their z-position. Hereby, the first 4 datapoints were excluded from the fit due to strong spherical aberrations.

The full dataset was then analyzed with Eigenfeature-based finding (*Positive polarity:* Linearity cutoff = 0.7, Maximum Eigenvalue cutoff = 23.5, Number of neighbours = 30, Ratio ms to px = 2.5, DBSCAN epsilon = 3 and DBSCAN nr. neighbours = 15; *Negative Polarity:* Linearity cutoff = 0.7, Maximum Eigenvalue cutoff = 17.2, Number of neighbours = 30, Ratio ms to px = 6.0, DBSCAN epsilon = 3 and DBSCAN nr. neighbours = 15) and astigmatic Gaussian fitting (Time fit routine = Average time, distribution = 2D histogram of x,y positions, expected width = 200., fitting tolerance = 5.0; same parameters for both event polarities). 

## Hardware and software environment
All analysis was performed on a 64-bit PC equipped with a i5-12400 12th gen Intel Core processor (6 cores, 12 threads) at 2.50 GHz, 32 GB RAM (3600 MT/s), NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti (7680 cores, 12 GB memory), on a PRIME B660M-K D4 motherboard. EVE was run via Python 3.9.18 running in a Conda environment in Windows 11 Pro, and analysis was performed with processing parallelization turned on.
