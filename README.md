## Overview
Eve is a software package that provides a plethora of options to localize emitters from single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) experiments performed on a MetaVision event-based sensor (eveSMLM).
## Version
The `main` branch contains the latest running version of the software. The latest developments are stored in the `develop` branch.
## Installation
This software was tested under Linux Ubuntu 20.04 and Windows. Besides the drift correction module that contains and uses pre-compiled dll-files and is therefore only running on Windows, everthing is running under Linux and Windows.
The software requires Python 3.9.18.
